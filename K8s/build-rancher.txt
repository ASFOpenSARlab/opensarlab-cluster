A. Setup up Helm and Tiller

If Helm and Tiller are already setup, this can be skipped.
Deployment used performed using Helm charts. While this supposely makes things easier to deploy, it does add a certain complexity to the config files.

1. Install Helm to local computer

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get | bash`

2. Add a service account for Tiller to Rancher cluster

`kubectl --namespace kube-system create serviceaccount tiller`

3. Give the Tiller Service Account permissions.

`kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller`

4. Start

`helm init --service-account tiller --wait`

5. Secure from access inside the cluster

`kubectl patch deployment tiller-deploy --namespace=kube-system --type=json --patch='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/command", "value": ["/tiller", "--listen=localhost:44134"]}]'`

6. Verfiy versions of helm and tiller match. Might need to wait for initialization to finish before.

`helm version`


B. Install the Jupyterhub helm chart into Rancher

1. Install deployment using `jhub` for namespace and release name.

`helm repo add jupyterhub https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart/`
`helm repo update`
`helm upgrade --install jhub jupyterhub/jupyterhub --namespace jhub --version 0.7.0 --values config.yaml`

2. Within Rancher, make sure that the `jhub` namespace is within a project named `jupyterhub`.

3. Wait until the `hub` and `proxy` pods are running.

4. Get the public proxy ip for users to sign into.

EXTERNAL-IP of `proxy-public` found in `kubectl get service --namespace jhub`

5. Go to the previous IP in a browser, sign in, and use.


In the above workflow, the default JupyterHub and Jupyter Notebooks are used. Customizations can be made via `config.yaml`. Examples can be found at https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/latest/user-environment.html
